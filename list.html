      <h2>10: Taylor Moore</h2>
      <p>His photography is simply amazing. It evokes a feeling of isolation, due to the vibrant environment, as well as of communion and association, owing to the historical sites on display.</p>

      <h2>9: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Elfman>Danny Elfman</a></h2>
      <p>This man is an incredible musician and does more awesome work on film scoring and soundtracks (for example, <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i> and <i>Sweeney Todd</i>). Featuring classics from Stevie Wonder; The Dave Brubeck Quartet; Les Paul and Mary Ford; and Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins; as well as modern tracks from Jessie J, alt-J, and Alabama Shakes, the soundtrack to Silver Linings Playbook was absolutely enchanting work by Danny Elfman. My favorite song by far on the soundtrack is <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEUGTpA0-UU>a re-recording of "Goodnight Moon" by Shivaree</a>.</p>
      <h2>8: Glass Animals</h2>
      <p>A relatively new fusion of indie alternative and electronic/trance styles, this band is astoundingly soothing.</p>
      <h2>7: Jean Deaux</h2>
      <p>I found out about her because of a feature she did with the Glass Animals (Woozy was the name). She is a Chicagoan rapper and hip hop artist that just put out her first mixtape this year. That said, she has done an astounding number of features with fairly high level artists. My favorite songs from her are "Escape" and "Noah and the Reign" (in the latter she was only a featured artist).</p>
      <h2>6: Nicholas Brigante</h2>
      <p>Brigante was a fabulous watercolor painter that was most active between the 1920s and 40s. My favorite painting by him is not easily found online (I saw it at the Laguna Art Museum), but the following is a part of it.</p>
      <p><img src=http://www.tobeycmossgallery.com/images/brigante/v8/arroyo.jpg></p>
      <h2>5: TSOL & Tender Fury</h2>
      <p>This is a highly political punk band active in Southern California in the 1980s. Songs such as "World War III" and "Property is Theft" reflect a throwback to 1950s beatnik generation and 1960s counterculture.</p>
      <h2>4: Sóley</h2>
      <p>An enchanting icelandic voice with very simple yet interesting percussion accompaniment. She uses layering, looping, and other effects, similar to Kimbra, in order to push her voice farther and create a full and entertaining sound. My favorite song of her's is "I'll Drown".</p>
      <h2>3: Flight Facilites</h2>
      <p>These guys put out a few tracks a while back that had an incredible funk/soul sound, but they are mostly an electro-pop group. Their music videos are simply amazing, especially for Claire de Lune.</p>
      <h2>2: Kasabian</h2>
      <p>Insanely good guitar and bass -- vocals and lyrics just knock it out of the park. This band is full of pure energy and passion. They did this very uncharacteristic (but hilarious) cover of the Sesame Street theme song, so they have that going for them (which is nice).</p>

      <h2>1: Jefferson Airplane</h2>
      <p>Oh. My. Lord. Pyschedelic rock bring me home. This band has an amazing vibe and sound. The lead singer's voice is penetratingly pleasant. Feed your head, man -- <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WANNqr-vcx0>feed your head</a>.</p>
